EAN-13/UPC barcode renderer

Creates barcodes. Enter a 13-digit number in the input field - the app draws the code.

It has a non-interactive mode which makes this piece of JS useful for embedding, i.e. in printable HTML: append a http parameter to the URL, for example '?ean=4002051684617' (without the '). This will render only the result without the input field. Try it and copy-and-paste the example to the end of the address string in your browser window.
