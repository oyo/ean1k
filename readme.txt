EAN-13/UPC barcode renderer

Creates the popular barcodes, that are used to identify many products. Enter a 13-digit number in the input field - the 'application' draws the code.

It even has a non-interactive mode, which makes this piece of JS really useful for embedding, i.e. in printable HTML: just append a http parameter to the URL, for example '?ean=4002051684617' (without the ') and you get only the result without the input field. Try it and copy-and-paste the example to the end of the address string in your browser window.

Update: set code to 0 when non-digits are entered
